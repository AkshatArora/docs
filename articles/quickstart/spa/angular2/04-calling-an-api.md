## Set the Audience and Scope in `auth0.WebAuth`

Pass the API identifier for your newly created API as the `audience` value in your `auth0.WebAuth` instance. Additionally, pass any of your newly created scopes to the `scope` key.

```ts
// src/app/auth/auth.service.ts

auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({
  // ...
  audience: '{YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER}',
  scope: 'openid profile read:messages'
});
```

At this point you should try logging into your application again to take note of how the `access_token` differs from before. Instead of being an opaque token, it is now a JSON Web Token which has a payload that contains your API identifier as an `audience` and any `scope`s you've requested.

> **Note:** By default, any user on any client can ask for any scope defined in the scopes configuration area. You can implement access policies to limit this behaviour via [Rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).

## Configure angular2-jwt

<%= include('../_includes/_calling_api_access_token') %>

The [angular2-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt) module can be used to automatically attach JSON Web Tokens to requests made with Angular's `Http` class. To to so, it provides an `AuthHttp` class which is a wrapper over `Http`.

If you haven't already done so, install angular2-jwt.

```bash
# installation with npm
npm install --save angular2-jwt

# installation with yarn
yarn add angular2-jwt
```

Create a factory function with some configuration values for angular2-jwt and add it to the `providers` array in your application's `@NgModule`. The factory function should have a `tokenGetter` functon which fetches the `access_token` from local storage.

```ts
// src/app/app.module.ts

import { Http, RequestOptions } from '@angular/http';
import { AuthHttp, AuthConfig } from 'angular2-jwt';

export function authHttpServiceFactory(http: Http, options: RequestOptions) {
  return new AuthHttp(new AuthConfig({
    tokenGetter: (() => localStorage.getItem('access_token'))
  }), http, options);
}

@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [...],
  providers: [
    AuthService,
    {
      provide: AuthHttp,
      useFactory: authHttpServiceFactory,
      deps: [Http, RequestOptions]
    }
  ],
  bootstrap: [...]
})
```

## Make Authenticated Calls with `AuthHttp`

After angular2-jwt is configured, you can use the `AuthHttp` class to make secure calls to your API from anywhere in the application. To do so, inject `AuthHttp` in any component or service where it is needed and use it just as you would use Angular's regular `Http` class. Assuming you have an API which returns a `message` from some protected endpoint called `/private`, you could craft an API call as such:

```ts
// src/app/ping/ping.component.ts

import { AuthHttp } from 'angular2-jwt';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';

// ...
export class PingComponent {

  API_URL: string = 'http://<your-application-domain>/api';
  message: string;

  constructor(public authHttp: AuthHttp) {}

  public securedPing(): void {
    this.message = '';
    this.authHttp.get(`<%= "${this.API_URL}" %>/private`)
      .map(res => res.json())
      .subscribe(
        data => this.message = data.message,
        error => this.message = error
      );
  }
}
```
