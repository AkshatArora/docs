## About the Sample Applications

Each section of this guide has a unique downloadable sample. Within each of these samples you will find a very simple React application which utilizes a few components. The samples are built with **create-react-app** and use **react-router v4** (with `BrowserRouter`).

It should be noted that the sample applications are intentionally simplistic. The focus of this guide is on how to use Auth0 in a React application in general rather than on how to approach various architectural scenarios. However, Auth0 works well in any React setup and can be integrated with Flux, Redux, and other flavors that you may be interested in.
